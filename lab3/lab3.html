      <p>In certain kind of companies it's necessary to have a report which indicates all data of employees at the moment they enter and exit certain area, this is the reason
      why an object <i>Person</i> is created. The properties of the object are firstName,lastName,id,age and hour, fullName and changeID include methods for returning the complete
    name of the employee and the second one allows to change the id if necessary. </p>
      <p id="object"> </p>
      <p>And changing the id through the method we get</p>
      <p id="object1"> </p>
      <p>It is also posible to do this through a variable, and we get the following</p>
      <p id=asvar> </p>

    <h2>Questions and answers</h2>
      <strong>What are the differences and similarities between Java and JavaScript?</strong>
      <br>
      <strong>Differences: </strong><br>
    -Java is a statically typed language; JavaScript is dynamic. <br>
    -Java is class-based; JavaScript is prototype-based. <br>
    -Java constructors are special functions that can only be called at object creation; JavaScript "constructors" are just standard functions. <br>
    -Java requires all non-block statements to end with a semicolon; JavaScript inserts semicolons at the ends of certain lines. <br>
    -Java uses block-based scoping; JavaScript uses function-based scoping. <br>
    -Java has an implicit this scope for non-static methods, and implicit class scope; JavaScript has implicit global scope.<br>

      <strong>Similarities: </strong><br>
      -Sintax,these include comments, literals, identifiers, operators, and control statements). <br>

      <strong>What methods have the Date object? (List at least 5 *)</strong>
      <br>
      getDate() 	    Get the day as a number (1-31)<br>
      getDay() 	      Get the weekday as a number (0-6)<br>
      getFullYear() 	Get the four digit year (yyyy)<br>
      getHours() 	    Get the hour (0-23)<br>
      getMilliseconds() 	Get the milliseconds (0-999)<br>
      getMinutes() 	  Get the minutes (0-59)<br>
      getMonth() 	    Get the month (0-11)<br>
      getSeconds()    	Get the seconds (0-59)<br>
      getTime() 	      Get the time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970)<br>
      <br></br>
      <strong>What methods have the Arrays? (List at least 5 *)</strong>
      <br>
      arr.pop()   Removes the last element from an array <br>
      arr.push()   Adds a new element to an array (at the end)<br>
      arr.join()   Joins all array elements into a string<br>
      arr.shift() Removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index<br>
      arr.unshift() Adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements<br>
      <br></br>
      <strong>How a variable is declared within a function for local use?</strong>
      <br>
      The sintax of declaring a variable is always the same "var nameVar", the difference is where it is placed. In order to make it local, it
      must be declared inside the function. Example:
      <br>
      function myFunction(){
          var varName;   //local var
      }
      <br></br>
      <strong>What are the implications using global variables inside a function?</strong>
      <br>
      All scripts and functions on a web page can access it, so they can be overwritten.
      <br></br>
      <strong>What String method can be used to look for patterns in regular expressions? For what could you use this in a web application?</strong>
      <br>
      The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.
      It can be used for finding stuff, everyday when we seek something in internet we are likely to press ctrl+f to quickly find what we want,
      so this will help us to do this, making the search much more powerful (case insensitive for example).
